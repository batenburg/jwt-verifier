# JWT Verifier

This JWT Verifier is for Symfony and Laravel. Right now this package is in it is firs testing version.

## Future improvements

This package can be used with both Symfony as Laravel. For both frameworks you need to set up dependency injection.
1. Have a separate packages for Symfony and Laravel which use this packages.
2. Have a request in this package, so we do need require the Symfony request anymore as a dependency.
3. Add multiple adaptors to the package, so we can support more Packages.
